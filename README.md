# Diabetes-Disease-Detection
Predictive analysis for diabetes detection using ML algorithms (SVM, RF, DT, etc.) on two datasets (9 vs 22 features). Comparison of feature selection impact and SVM/SVR kernel performance (Linear, Poly, RBF, Sigmoid). Best results achieved: 97.32% accuracy with Decision Tree.
